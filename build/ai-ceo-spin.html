  <p>This week&rsquo;s episode of Hard Fork featured an interview with Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity. Perplexity is an AI-powered “answer engine” that summarizes search results.</p>
<p>Host Kevin Roose asked Mr. Srinivas if Perplexity would stop referring traffic to publishers, which is how the New York Times earns much of its revenue.</p>
<p>“A lot of publishers and journalists are very nervous about AI powered search engines, in particular, because referral traffic is one of the main ways that publishers are making money today - so - why should publishers not be terrified of what you&rsquo;re building”</p>
<p>Srinivas&rsquo;s response was total spin.</p>
<p>“We need to work together to build all these things (revenue models for publishers), rather than trying to see it like we&rsquo;re trying to take stuff and use it (without paying for it)&rdquo;</p>
<p>I see. So it&rsquo;s the New York Times job to figure all of this out. Got it. Meanwhile Perplexity (and OpenAI, etc.) will attempt to monetize their services while trying defend themselves <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/why-the-new-york-times-might-win-its-copyright-lawsuit-against-openai/5/">from lawsuits that hold them to account</a>.</p>
<p>Mr Srinivas even attempted to deny that Perplexity uses New York Times data:</p>
<p>“I am also sympathetic to the current lawsuit that is going on, where others are just taking people&rsquo;s data, and training their base foundation models, which we do not do, by the way. We don&rsquo;t train anything on anybody&rsquo;s data.“</p>
<p>Casey Newton interjected, “But you do use GPT as your underlying data,&rdquo; to which Mr. Srinivas dismissively answered &ldquo;yes, we use GPT, and Llama, etc.&rdquo; but doubled down on the claim that he isn&rsquo;t using anyone&rsquo;s data.</p>
<p>This is a new level of smoke, mirrors, and lying. Notice Mr. Srinivas uses words like &ldquo;base foundation models&rdquo; to try and separate himself from OpenAI. Technically, he&rsquo;s not training those models. But also, just as technically, he most certainly is using them. The end result is the same.</p>
<p>Journalism is often called the &ldquo;Fourth Estate&rdquo; because it plays a crucial role in informing the public about government policies and actions, holding those in power accountable, and ensuring transparency. But journalism has had a tough go over the last forty years or so, for many reasons, but largely because of the Internet.</p>
<p>Looks like that won&rsquo;t be getting better any time soon.</p>
