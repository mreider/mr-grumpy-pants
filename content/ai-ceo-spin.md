This week's episode of Hard Fork featured an interview with Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity, an AI-powered “answer engine” that summarizes search results.

Host Kevin Roose asked Mr. Srinivas if Perplexity intended to stop directing traffic to publishers, a significant revenue source for the New York Times.

“A lot of publishers and journalists are very nervous about AI powered search engines, in particular, because referral traffic is one of the main ways that publishers are making money today - so - why should publishers not be terrified of what you're building”

Srinivas's response was total spin.

“We need to work together to build all these things (revenue models for publishers), rather than trying to see it like we're trying to take stuff and use it (without paying for it)"

I see. So the burden is placed on the New York Times to solve this dilemma. Meanwhile, Perplexity (and others like OpenAI) aim to profit while fighting legal challenges about [content usage](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/why-the-new-york-times-might-win-its-copyright-lawsuit-against-openai/5/).

Mr. Srinivas also denied using New York Times data:

“I am also sympathetic to the current lawsuit that is going on, where others are just taking people's data, and training their base foundation models, which we do not do, by the way. We don't train anything on anybody's data.“

Casey Newton responded, “But you use GPT and Llama as your underlying data,” to which Mr. Srinivas briefly conceded, "yes, we use GPT and Llama," but insisted they don't use anyone's data.

Denying the use of "base foundation models" while sourcing them indirectly is like claiming "no child labor involved" simply because the production is outsourced. Mr. Srinivas, sharp as a tack, undeniably aware of his ethical distancing.

Journalism, often called the "Fourth Estate" due to its critical role in democracy, has always faced challenges posed by the Internet. Now, with AI, these challenges have only intensified.
