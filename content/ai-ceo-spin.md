This week's episode of Hard Fork featured an interview with Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity, an AI-powered “answer engine” that summarizes search results.

Host Kevin Roose asked Mr. Srinivas if Perplexity intended to stop directing traffic to publishers, a significant revenue source for the New York Times.

“A lot of publishers and journalists are very nervous about AI powered search engines, in particular, because referral traffic is one of the main ways that publishers are making money today - so - why should publishers not be terrified of what you're building”

Srinivas's response was total spin.

“We need to work together to build all these things (revenue models for publishers), rather than trying to see it like we're trying to take stuff and use it (without paying for it)"

I see. So the burden is placed on the New York Times to solve this dilemma. Meanwhile, Perplexity (and others like OpenAI) aim to profit while fighting legal challenges about [content usage](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/why-the-new-york-times-might-win-its-copyright-lawsuit-against-openai/5/).

Mr Srinivas even attempted to deny that Perplexity uses New York Times data:

“I am also sympathetic to the current lawsuit that is going on, where others are just taking people's data, and training their base foundation models, which we do not do, by the way. We don't train anything on anybody's data.“

Casey Newton interjected, “But you do use GPT as your underlying data," to which Mr. Srinivas dismissively answered "yes, we use GPT, and Llama, etc." but doubled down on the claim that he isn't using anyone's data.

This is a new level of smoke, mirrors, and lying. Notice Mr. Srinivas uses words like "base foundation models" to try and separate himself from OpenAI. Technically, he's not training those models. But also, just as technically, he most certainly is using them. The end result is the same.

Journalism is often called the "Fourth Estate" because it plays a crucial role in informing the public about government policies and actions, holding those in power accountable, and ensuring transparency. But journalism has had a tough go over the last forty years or so, for many reasons, but largely because of the Internet.

Looks like that won't be getting better any time soon.
