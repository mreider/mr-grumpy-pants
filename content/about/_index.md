I’m an American expat living in Vienna with my wife and kids. I enjoy writing but it's hard to put my thoughts into words. Initially, I began this blog by sharing short posts about our travels, but lately I’ve been exploring other topics. 

I try to be a supportive spouse, a committed father, and a reliable team member. It's two steps forward and one step back across the board.

I've been in the software industry for almost 30 years, was on the Allaire ColdFusion team in the 90's, and worked in Application Performance Monitoring in the 2000's and again in the 2020's with Dynatrace. I was on the original CloudFoundry team at VMware, which spun out to become Pivotal. These days I focus on Kubernetes and OpenTelemetry.

My mind is constantly on. Whether I'm riding the subway or walking the dog. I'm usually thinking about human behavior and why we act the way we do.

I listen to late 90's Beastie Boys, Radiohead, and Yacht Rock from the 70's. I watch Louis C.K., Chris Rock, and Dave Chapelle, The Matrix, and any movie starring Tom Hanks.
