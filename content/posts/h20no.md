H₂Oh No

Another year slipped by like a [Northern Pike](https://www.donauauen.at/wissen/natur-wissenschaft/fauna/hecht-esox-lucius) swimming downstream. A lot of things happened. Too many to review.

Today I'll write, [again](/posts/wasser-acqua-voda/), about water.

Vienna's water supply is world famously clean. It comes straight from the Alps and doesn't need any treatment at all. No chlorine, no filtration. You can read more about it in [this offical Vienna water flyer](/images/drinking-water-vienna.pdf). Yes, I read municipal water reports. Don't judge.

Sadly, our house isn’t linked to the local water system. Instead, we rely on a well. The reason remains a mystery - it’s just part of the “charm” of our rental. This well water is suitable for cooking and brushing teeth, but not for drinking. Too much calcium. So we get our water from a dispenser. A truck delivers five jugs per month.

Our water company is [Aqua Alpina](https://www.aquaalpina.at/). Here's a very skinny lady from their website. Guessing she skips lunch and dinner.

Anyhow - the water we get isn't chilled, so we fill some bottles and refrigerate them. The cycle is simple: fill a bottle, use it, empty it, refill it. Or you'd think it's simple. It's really not.

What's annoying, at least for me, is my inability to ignore bottles that aren't full. When I see a half-empty bottle on the counter I feel an immediate need to fill it. My compulsion makes everyone a little crazy. Mid-conversation with my wife, if I see a bottle, I have to fill it. Then there's the kids. They make me crazy. They drain each bottle without ever refilling them. By the weekend’s end, the fridge is always full of nearly empty bottles.

On the upside, this stuff provides some unexpected exercise. The dispenser is 10 meters from the fridge, making it a 20-meter round trip. That’s 40 meters daily, 280 meters weekly, and about 14 km annually. So there's some extra walking to keep the family hydrated.

Yes. You've got me. I'm thinking metric rather than imperial these days. But the jugs make that one harder. Water jugs are definitely produced with the US in mind, since each jug is about 19.1 liters, and thus, exactly 5 gallons. Same goes for mountain bike tires, by the way, which are sold to Europeans in inches, for some crazy reason.

More useless information for your heads. You're welcome.
