H₂Oh No

Another year slipped by like a wet bar of soap. A lot of things happened. Too many to review.

Today I'll write, [again](/posts/wasser-acqua-voda/), about water.

Vienna's water supply is world famously clean. It comes straight from the Alps and doesn't need any treatment at all. No chlorine, no filtration. You can read more about it in [this info sheet](/images/drinking-water-vienna.pdf) I downloaded from the Stadt Wien website. (Yes, I read municipal water reports. Don't judge.)

But our house doesn’t get this water. Our water comes from a well. It’s okay for cooking or brushing teeth, but not for drinking. We get our drinking water from a dispenser. A truck brings us five jugs every month.

The water from the dispenser isn’t cold, so we always fill bottles and put them in the fridge. Fill a bottle, use it, fill it again. Sounds simple, right? But it’s not.
Here’s why. If all four bottles aren’t full and in the fridge, I can’t relax. If I see a half-full bottle, I have to fill it right away. I might go to the fridge for cheese, but I come out with a water bottle to fill.

This also affects my relationships. My wife could be talking, and suddenly, I see a bottle. I stop listening. This wouldn’t happen so much if it weren’t for the kids. They leave bottles everywhere. They drink a bit from each one and never fill them back up. Sometimes, the fridge is full of almost empty bottles. Guess who fills them up?

People can view a glass as half full. In my case, it’s always half empty, waiting for a refill. But let’s spin it optimistically. I fill about two bottles per day. The dispenser is a 10-meter walk from the fridge, that’s a 20-meter journey. 40 meters daily. It adds up to 280 meters weekly and about 14 kilometers annually. So, when I back up and think about it, I’m adding a lot of walking to my routine, all in the pursuit of a well-hydrated family.
