H₂Oh No

Another year slipped by like a wet bar of soap. A lot of things happened. Too many to review.

Today I'll write, [again](/posts/wasser-acqua-voda/), about water.

Vienna's water supply is world famously clean. It comes straight from the Alps and doesn't need any treatment at all. No chlorine, no filtration. You can read more about it in [this offical Vienna water flyer](/images/drinking-water-vienna.pdf). Yes, I read municipal water reports. Don't judge.

Sadly, our house isn’t linked to the local water system. Instead, we rely on a well. The reason remains a mystery - it’s just part of the “charm” of our rental. This well water is suitable for cooking and brushing teeth, but not for drinking. Hence, we get our water from a dispenser. A truck delivers five jugs per month.

Our water company is [Aqua Alpina](https://www.aquaalpina.at/). Here's a very skinny lady from their website. Guessing she skips lunch and dinner.

Anyhow - the water we get isn't chilled, so we fill a few 1.5 liter bottles and refrigerate them. The cycle is simple: fill a bottle, use it, empty it, refill it. Or you'd think it's simple. It's sorta not.

What's annoying, at least for me, is my inability to ignore bottles that aren't full. When I see a half-empty bottle on the counter I feel an immediate need to fill it. My compulsion makes everyone a little crazy. Mid-conversation with my wife, if I see a bottle, I have to fill it. Then there's my kids. They make me crazy. They drain each bottle without ever refilling them. By the weekend’s end, the fridge is always full of nearly empty bottles.

On the upside, this routine provides a little unexpected exercise. The dispenser is a 10-meter stroll from the fridge, making it a 20-meter round trip. That’s 40 meters daily, 280 meters weekly, and about 14 km annually. So I’m adding a bit of walking to my routine, all in the name of keeping the family hydrated.
