Another year slipped by like a [Northern Pike](https://www.donauauen.at/wissen/natur-wissenschaft/fauna/hecht-esox-lucius) headed downstream. A lot of things happened. Too many to review.

Today I'll write, [again](/posts/wasser-acqua-voda/), about water.

Vienna's water supply is world famously clean. It comes straight from the Alps and doesn't need any treatment at all. No chlorine, no filtration. You can read more about it in [this offical Vienna water flyer](/images/drinking-water-vienna.pdf). Yes, I read municipal water reports. Don't judge.

Sadly, our house isn’t linked to the local water system. Instead, we rely on a well. The reason remains a mystery - it’s just part of the “charm” of our rental. This well water is suitable for cooking and brushing teeth, but not for drinking. Too much calcium. So we get our water from a dispenser. A truck delivers five jugs per month.

Our water company is [Aqua Alpina](https://www.aquaalpina.at/). Here's a very skinny lady from their website. Guessing she skips lunch and dinner.

Anyhow - the water we get isn't chilled, so we fill some bottles and refrigerate them. The cycle is simple: fill a bottle, use it, empty it, refill it. Or you'd think it's simple. It's really not.

First problem is my ADD. I am completely unable to ignore bottles that aren't full. If there's a half-empty bottle on the counter I drop everything to fill it. My compulsion makes everyone a little crazy.

Second problem is the kids. Way too lazy about refilling bottles. They'rs crafty about it too - they drain each one to a level that is arguably not-yet-empty, and thus not-yet-necessary to refill. By Sunday the fridge contains five separate bottles with a tiny gulp in each.

Third problem is the combination of the first two problems. There's also a Long Island bred (a.k.a loud-ish) wife wandering around, expressing that these, and other problems, should be resolved a.s.a.p.

Let's turn to the upside then. The dispenser is 10 meters from the fridge. A 20-meter round trip. That’s 40 meters daily, 280 meters weekly, and about 14 km per year. So there's the benefit of some exercise in keeping these folks hydrated.

Aprapos of nothing, while my exercise is calculated in meters the water jugs are very imperial. Each one is 18.927 liters or 5 gallons. This is another mystery.

Same thing goes for mountain bike tires, by the way, which are sold to Europeans in inches, not centimeters, even though nobody knows what an inch looks like over here. 

More useless information for your heads. You're welcome.
