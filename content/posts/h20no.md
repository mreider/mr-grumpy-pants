H₂Oh No

Another year slipped by like a wet bar of soap. A lot of things happened. Too many to review.

Today I'll write, [again](/posts/wasser-acqua-voda/), about water.

Vienna's water supply is world famously clean. It comes straight from the Alps and doesn't need any treatment at all. No chlorine, no filtration. You can read more about it in [this offical Vienna water flyer](/images/drinking-water-vienna.pdf). Yes, I read municipal water reports. Don't judge.

Sadlyt, our residence isn’t linked to the local water system. Instead, we rely on a well. The reason remains a mystery - it’s just part of the “charm” of our rental. This well water is suitable for cooking and brushing teeth, but not for drinking. Hence, we get our water from a dispenser. A truck delivers five jugs per month.

These water jugs aren’t chilled, so we transfer the water into five glass bottles for refrigeration. The cycle is simple: fill a bottle, use it, empty it, refill it. Or you'd think that's simple. It's not.

The challenge, at least for me, is an inability to ignore a bottle that isn’t full. Spotting a half-empty bottle triggers an immediate need to refill it. This peculiar compulsion has a way of intruding on my interactions. Mid-conversation with my wife, an empty bottle catches my eye, and I’m compelled to fill it. There's also a bit of a blame game. My children are always the culprits, sipping from each bottle without ever refilling them. By the weekend’s end, the fridge is always full of nearly empty bottles.

On the upside, this routine provides a little unexpected exercise. The dispenser is a 10-meter stroll from the fridge, making it a 20-meter round trip. That’s 40 meters daily, 280 meters weekly, and about 14 km annually. So I’m adding a bit of walking to my routine, all in the name of keeping the family hydrated.
