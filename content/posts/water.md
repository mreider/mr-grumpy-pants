Another year has gone by. A lot of things have happened. Too many to review. I also updated the blog's theme to allow for different topics - not just travel or the experience of being an expat in a far-away place.

Today I'll write, [again](/posts/wasser-acqua-voda/), about water.

Vienna’s Water Supply comes from mountain springs in the Lower Austrian-Styrian Alps. The water is remarkably clean and doesn't need any treatment. You can read more about that in [this info sheet](/images/drinking-water-vienna.pdf) I downloaded from the Stadt Wien website.

Our house, in the 22nd district of Vienna, is not connected to the water system. Our water comes from a well under the house, and it's too rich in calcium to drink every day. It's fine for boiling pasta or brushing your teeth, but it's not safe to drink. Our cat, George, developed some bladder issues after our cat-sitter gave him tap water while we were on vacation. He's fine now. And she knows what to do next time.

Instead of buying endless supplies of bottled water, we have one of these water dispensers you might find in an office. Every month, a big truck delivers five big jugs and takes back the empties. The dispenser unit is electric, but it only has a heater, not a cooler, so we are constantly re-filling the same glass bottles and returning them to the fridge.

This act of filling water bottles has led to some new behaviors. Or maybe it just encourages existing behaviors.

For me, the act of filling water bottles triggers some attention deficit issues. It's honestly difficult for me to relax or even pay attention to anything that is happening if there's an empty water bottle on the counter. That thing needs to be filled. God help me if there are two or even three bottles on the counter, or if all five bottles are half-full in the fridge. I often combine the half-full bottles to get a single chilled one and reduce the number of required trips across the room.

For my kids, filling water bottles is simply an extension of their general lazy attitude and inability to help around the house. Sometimes they'll fill a bottle, but usually not, and always on prompting. They do seem to put their dishes in the dishwasher. So there's hope.

For my wife, this situation makes her wonder about the rest of us. Why is my husband filling a bottle midway through a conversation we were having? Why are my kids not doing their part? Fortunately, for all of us, she expresses these things very clearly, you know, in case we have any confusion about where she stands.

But we don't let the water situation or our flaws ruin our mood. We still like living in Vienna. It's a nice city with a lot to offer. We enjoy the culture, the history, the architecture, the parks, the cafes, and the people. We know that every place and every person has their good and bad sides, and we deal with them as they come. We've learned to appreciate the water we have, and the water we don't. We've also learned to accept ourselves and each other, with our quirks and habits. It's part of our life here, and we're fine with that.

So, is the water situation a big deal? Not really. It’s just one of those things that we have to deal with, like heating the house with a pellet stove, or owning a dog with weird habits. We’re generally pretty happy here, and that’s what matters.
