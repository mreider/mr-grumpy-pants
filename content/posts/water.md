Another year went by. A lot of things happened. Too many to review. 

I updated my blog's theme to allow for different topics - not just travel or the experience of being an expat in a far-away place.

Today I'll write, [again](/posts/wasser-acqua-voda/), about water.

Vienna’s Water Supply comes from the Alps. The water is remarkably clean and doesn't need any treatment. You can read more about that in [this info sheet](/images/drinking-water-vienna.pdf) I downloaded from the Stadt Wien website.

Our house, in the 22nd district of Vienna, is not connected to the water system. Our water comes from a well, and it's too rich in calcium to drink every day. It's fine for boiling pasta or brushing your teeth, but it's not safe to drink.

Instead of buying bottled water, we have one of these water dispensers you might find in an office. Every month, a big truck delivers five jugs and takes the empties. The dispenser is room temperature, so we are constantly re-filling a set of IKEA glass bottles for the fridge.

This act of filling water bottles has led to new family dynamics. Or maybe it just encourages existing ones.

For me, it triggers my ADD. It's honestly difficult for me to pay attention to anything if there's an empty water bottle on the counter. Bottles must be filled. God help me if there are two or even three bottles on the counter, or if all five bottles are half-full in the fridge. I must combine the half-full bottles to get a single one and reduce the number of refill trips across the room.

For my kids, filling water bottles an extension of their inability to help around the house. Sometimes they'll fill a bottle, but never without our asking. They groan as if they're carrying boulders.

For my wife, the water situation makes her wonder about her life choices. Why is my husband filling a bottle midway through our conversation? Why are my kids unable to fill a water bottle without asking them over, and over, and over, and...

Fortunately, for all
of us, my wife expresses these thoughts clearly, and directly, in case we have any confusion about where she stands.

Is the water situation such a big deal? Ot course not. It’s just one of those things, like heating the house with a pellet stove, or owning a dog with weird habits. We’re generally pretty ok, overall, and that’s what matters.
