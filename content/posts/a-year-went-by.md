I stopped writing over a year ago. Not sure why. Wasn't feeling it.

But today I'll give you a short update.

We've experienced some new things. We went skiing on a couple of glaciers. We bought a hyperactive dog named Leo. We visited friends and family in America and then went scuba diving in Costa Rica. In autumn we saw Belgium, then climbed up the Eiffel Tower. Then it was winter again.  We went to Florence with my niece, sister, mom+husband. Then we kicked off 2022 with schnapps and skiing in East Tirol.

You're  mostly caught up.

Some big news. We moved from Linz to Vienna in August. Now we have more choices for art, culture, and food. We also have a real airport with flights around the world. The move was really about the kids though - they go to a great international school and have lots of new friends.

And now it's March. And sadly, most of our attention is on Ukraine, which is a six hour drive from Vienna through Slovakia. Many of our workmates are from Ukraine, and it's hard to imagine what they're going through.  The whole thing is horrible. And while I've always been full of opinions, and enjoy discussing politics or history, I don't have much more to say on this one.

Here are some pictures of stuff we've done in the last year - most recent pics first.
